# Press T For Tile

This is a small mod for Garden Galaxy that adds a keybind to toggle the tile lock.

It does what it sounds like... Press T.

## Installation

This mod will require BepInEx to be installed, follow the instructions here: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

After that is done, just drop the latest plugin file into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's directory.

Enjoy. :)
